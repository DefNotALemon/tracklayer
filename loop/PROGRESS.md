# Builder progress log

Newest first. One entry per builder pass:

```
## <date time> — <short title> (Gn) — <landed hash | not landed: why>
What changed for the player, numbers before → after (gameClock), smoke result, stills judged (paths), what's next.
```

## 2026-10-26 01:15 — Walking pace in powder up ~45%, tiredness softer (G1) — 31a0364
Fresh powder: `wade` floor 0.42 → 0.57 and full pace 2.7 → 2.9 m/s in `footStep`; tiredness builds
0.07 → 0.04 ×strain/s and recovers 0.05 → 0.08/s (tired only drives the pose/breathing, not speed).
New scenario `g1_walk30.mjs` (30 m of powder from a standstill, then 25 m back along the trench):
powder 30 m **28.1 s → 19.3 s** (avg 1.07 → 1.56 m/s), tired at 30 m 1.00 → 0.77; trench 1.96 → 2.23 m/s
(trench/powder ratio 1.83 → 1.43, still clearly faster). smoke.mjs: powder 1.01 → 1.51, trench 1.75 → 2.13,
exit 0, page errors none. Stills before/after (side + chase): same stride and trench, after reads less
hunched; no regressions. README walking paragraph updated; script v58.
Triage: report 0001 → finding 1 (no slope term on foot) became a backlog item; findings 2 (obstacle
collision clean) and 3 (turn rate = spec) are confirmations, no item. Reordered: did this G1 pace item ahead
of the G2 audit since it's Lemon's first-named complaint and a direct player win; the audit is next.
Next: G2 ladder audit; then slope on foot; town/quay walking check.
